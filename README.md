This game is titled "Catfishing."

The intent of this game is to allow players an experience to move around a cat's paw to catch fish.

The narrative of this game is that the player is a cat at a fish market, trying to snag as many fish as you can before they reach the floor.

The only real mechanic of this game that takes in player input is the ability to move the cat's paw around using your mouse. Other mechanics that happen in the background, but still visible to the player is the score and misses counter. The score counter starts at 0 and counts up by 1 every time you catch a fish, which also plays an audio of the cat meowing. The misses counter starts at 5 and counts down by 1 every time you miss a fish, which also plays the cat hissing. If you miss 5 fish in total, the score is reset to 0 and the misses left is reset to 5.

The aesthetics of this game are very singularly focused. You are a cat, shown by a paw, who is trying to catch fish that fall from the top of the game screen. The game takes place on a beach at a fish market. The only two sounds that are a part of this game are of a cat meowing and hissing.

Fin's Joys and Struggles -

  Joys: 
  
    It was really fun to figure out Unity. I was initially not excited to learn it because of it's bad press recently, but I found that I really enjoyed it. Not having to give it it's own
    physics rules was incredibly nice. Any time that anything worked and pushed was also a joyful thing to me.
  Struggles:
  
    Sometimes when I cloned the repository, something would break during the cloning process. At one point, I had to clone it 3 times to get it right, without making any changes (it literally
    just didn't work sometimes). I usually had to clone it only 2 times. In addition to this, it would occasionally break in the middle of me working on something, so I had to restart from the 
    last push. It was usually fine, because it would happen while I spent a long time on research and coding, so I would know what to do exactly when I re-cloned it (but it was still very
    annoying).

    I really enjoyed learning how to make this because I love creating things. Being able to mix creativity with coding is a very fulfilling experience for me!
    
  Struggles:
    I struggled with getting this project started and getting on the same page as my partner. I had a lot of problems with getting VS to work properly with Unity.

Fin's contributions:

  - Created the repository.
  - Made the code that let the fish drop continuously from random x-values in the scene (but a set y-value).
  - Made the score counter increment when fish are caught and not when they spawn.
  - Created the miss counter (did not perfect it, but did a lot for it).
  - Made the fish be destroyed upon being caught or missed (so they did not just continue to exist).
  - Added audio assets (only the audio assets).
  - Uploaded to itch.io.

Leigh's contributions:

  - Created the initial Unity Project
  - Started the first steps of adding objects and scripts
  - Coded user input to move the cat paw
  - Created Game Manager
  - Created scoring base
  - Added Score text
  - Found and added visual assets
  - Made the game get more diffifult as the player gets more points (spawn rate of fish gets higher)
